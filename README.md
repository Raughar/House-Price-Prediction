In this project, we aim to predict the evolution of prices of a house and the factors that will impact that evolution.

To achieve that, we will use the following technologies:
    -Python
        To do the EDA, data cleaning, data pre-processing and then apply the machine learning.

    -SQL
        To create a database with the .csv file as a base. Then use it to run different queries to get specific information.

    -Tableau
        To create a dashboard with the plots and information that will led us to easy to understand data and succesful presentation.
